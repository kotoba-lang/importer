  "Provider records to the canonical shape.

  Two decisions here are load-bearing rather than tidying.

  **An address is identity; a display name is not.** Gmail hands over an RFC
  5322 header string, Graph hands over a nested map, and both carry a name that
  changes between messages from the same person. Keying on anything but the
  lower-cased address splits the person graph, which is exactly the join a
  corpus exists to make possible.

  **A message id must not name its provider.** The same message reaches a
  Gmail mailbox and an Exchange mailbox with different provider ids and the
  same RFC 5322 Message-ID. Keying on the provider id stores it twice, and
  every later count, thread and answer is quietly doubled for anyone in both
  systems -- which, for a company that migrated, is everyone."
